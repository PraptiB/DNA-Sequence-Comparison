# To provide insights into the structural and functional properties of the DNA sequences, such as the presence of conserved domains or regulatory regions.

DNA is a molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. Scientists study DNA to understand its structure and functions. This code helps compare two DNA sequences and find their similarities.

The code uses two algorithms called Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) to compare the two DNA sequences. LCS finds the longest common subsequence between the two sequences, which represents the portion of the sequences that is most similar. LIS then finds the longest subsequence in increasing order within the LCS, which can provide insights into the functional properties of the DNA sequences.

By comparing DNA sequences, scientists can learn about the similarities and differences between organisms, the function of different genes, and the evolution of species. This code provides a tool to aid in this research and to help scientists gain a better understanding of the structural and functional properties of DNA.
