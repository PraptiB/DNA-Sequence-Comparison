# Problem Statment:To provide insights into the structural and functional properties of the DNA sequences, such as the presence of conserved domains or regulatory regions.

The program is designed to compare two strands of DNA and find the parts that are the same in both strands. It does this by using a method called dynamic programming to find the longest sequence that is present in both strands. Once it has found this sequence, it then looks for the longest sequence of increasing letters within that shared sequence. This is useful because it can help us understand how two strands of DNA are related to each other.

The program has a graphical user interface (GUI) which makes it easy for the user to input the two DNA strands they want to compare. Once they have done this, they can click a button to start the comparison process. The results of the comparison are then displayed in the GUI, so the user can see which parts of the two DNA strands are the same and what the longest increasing sequence is.

Overall, this program is useful for scientists and researchers who are working with DNA sequences, as it allows them to quickly compare two strands and find commonalities between them.
